# Wine_Project_Machine_Learning

Educating and fun project created by me and my college friend group.

Together we experimented with different Machine Learning techniques, such as using different supervised algorithms, feature engineering, cross-validation methods, and so on.

The project was created in a shareable Google Collab notebook.
